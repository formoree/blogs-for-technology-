### 2006 Text-4 Art Of Unhappiness
#### 前三段介绍艺术在每个阶段承担作用及原因
* The earliest forms of art are those best suited for expressing joy.
* But from the 19th century, more artists began seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all and more focus on unhappiness.
* there is too much damn happiness in the world today.

#### 四五六段讨论现代和早期艺术在快乐表达的差异
*  The rise of anti-happy art tracks the emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just an ideal but an ideology.(不是一种理想，而是意识形态)
*  People in earlier eras did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.(bummer->unpleasant 人们因为禁受太多痛苦而不希望艺术也过多表达痛苦)
*  Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but commercial, and forever happy.(现代艺术表达的是永久的快乐)

#### 作者观点
* you will die, that everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it.(你终将死亡，一切都会结束，幸福的到来不是因为否认这一点，而是对其加以忍受。)**所以说作者要表达的是我们对于苦难并不是要享受它，而是忍受它!**
* It’s a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.(这一启示甚至比叶子 烟还要苦，但却不知何故带来了一缕清新的空气)(这等于说“反快乐的艺术虽然令人感觉不快(distasteful)——因为它让人意识到存在不幸，但令人有清新之感(refreshing) ——因为这是人必须接受的一个事实”)
